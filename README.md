# Hi-Mom
Project of saying "Hi Mom" in every language know to man

# RULES:
- The text does not need to be visual
- Altered versions of a language are not accepted (e.g. React)
- The text must say "Hi Mom", case sensitive
- Seperate packages are allowed (exluding large packages)
- It must be in a single file

# Notes:
- Even though html is not a language, I included js inside of it, which is not against the rules.
